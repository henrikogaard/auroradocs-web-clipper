# Setup

This guide installs AuroraDocs Web Clipper `0.2.1`, connects it to one
AuroraCloud-compatible workspace, and verifies a first capture.

## Requirements

- a Chromium-based browser with Manifest V3 extension support
- an AuroraCloud or compatible self-hosted workspace
- the workspace API URL and Workspace ID
- an AuroraDocs email and password with access to the workspace

Browser-only and Local folders workspaces are not supported because the
extension sends clips to an AuroraCloud-compatible API.

## Install the release

1. Download `auroradocs-web-clipper-0.2.1.zip` from the
   [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/henrikogaard/auroradocs-web-clipper/releases).
2. Extract the ZIP to a stable folder that will remain on your computer.
3. Open `chrome://extensions`.
4. Enable **Developer mode**.
5. Select **Load unpacked** and choose the extracted folder containing
   `manifest.json`.
6. Pin AuroraDocs Web Clipper from the browser Extensions menu if desired.

Do not delete or move the extracted folder while the extension is installed.

## Connect AuroraDocs

1. Open the extension popup.
2. Keep `https://api.auroradocs.eu`, or enter the API URL supplied by your
   self-hosted administrator. Self-hosted APIs must use HTTPS; `http://localhost`
   and `http://127.0.0.1` are allowed for local development.
3. In AuroraDocs, open **Settings → Workspace** and copy the value from
   **Workspace ID**, then enter it in the popup. For a self-hosted workspace,
   ask its administrator for both the API URL and Workspace ID.
4. Enter your AuroraDocs email and password, then select **Sign in**.
5. If MFA is required, enter an authenticator code or request an email code.

The extension stores its refreshable session in `chrome.storage.local`; the API
URL and Workspace ID use extension sync storage. MCP tokens are not used by the
Web Clipper and must not be pasted into it.

## Verify a capture

1. Open a normal web page that you are allowed to save.
2. Open the extension and choose **Clip page**.
3. Open the AuroraDocs Inbox and confirm the bookmark title and source URL.
4. Select text on a page, open the extension, and choose **Clip selection**.
5. Confirm the Inbox page contains the selected content and source link.

Browser-managed pages, extension pages, and protected store pages cannot be
captured.

## Update the extension

1. Download and extract the new release to a stable folder.
2. Open `chrome://extensions`.
3. The **Reload** path preserves the existing local session: replace the files
   in the currently loaded folder and select **Reload** on the extension card.
4. Alternatively, remove the old entry and use **Load unpacked** with the new
   folder. Removal deletes the local session. Open the popup, sign in again,
   and complete MFA again if prompted.
5. Verify the API URL, Workspace ID, and sign-in state.
6. Repeat one **Clip page** verification.

## Sign out or Uninstall

- Select **Sign out** in the popup to delete the local AuroraDocs session.
- Remove the extension from `chrome://extensions` to delete its local session
  from that browser profile.
- Connection settings may remain in another synced browser profile; remove the
  extension there as well when required.
- Clips already stored in AuroraDocs are not deleted when the extension is
  removed.
